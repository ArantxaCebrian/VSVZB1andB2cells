# VSVZB1andB2cells
Code used in the analysis of the study: Neural Stem Cell Relay from B1 to B2 cells in the adult mouse Ventricular-Subventricular Zone. 

Raw data: The newly generated scRNA-seq data from V-SVZ containing apically-labeled cells and microdissections at P30, and V-SVZ cells from P365 mice, is deposited in NCBIâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE282956). The scRNA-seq data from the non-infected V-SVZ at P3023 is available (GEO GSE165555). Processed data files from the integrated datasets are deposited in (GSE282956). Web-based interactive version is available at the University of California Santa Cruz Cell Browser: https://svzneurogeniclineage.cells.ucsc.edu. 


The code is organized in separate notebooks for each step of the analysis:
